Each component is built according to jQuery's event-driven architecture (find something, manipulate it) and is themeable, making it easy for developers of any skill level to integrate and extend into their own code.\n    NOTE: This package is maintained on behalf of the library owners by the NuGet Community Packages project at http://nugetpackages.codeplex.com/",
