    \nAny FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in its original release form, or whether\
    \ in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms of the GNU General\
    \ Public License plus this exception. An independent module is a module which is not derived\
    \ from or based on FreeRTOS.\r\n\r\nEXCEPTION TEXT:\r\n\r\nClause 1\r\nLinking FreeRTOS\
    \ statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on FreeRTOS.\
    \ Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\r\
    \n\r\nAs a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission to link\
    \ FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS solely through the FreeRTOS\
    \ API interface, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy\
    \ and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice, provided that\r\
    \n1. Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that details\
    \ to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself to provide the\
    \ FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have made) should the recipient\
    \ request it.\r\n2. The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related\
    \ product.\r\n3. The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS\
    \ and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present in FreeRTOS.\r\n\r\
    \nClause 2\r\nFreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including\
    \ the publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express permission\
    \ of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and is intended to ensure\
    \ information accuracy)."
