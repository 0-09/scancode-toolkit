    \ 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs whose\r\nsources are distributed under a license\
    \ that complies with the Open\r\nSource definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without\
    \ libcygwin.a\r\nitself causing the resulting program to be covered by the GNU GPL.\r\n\r\
    \nThis means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin,\r\nand distribute\
    \ that executable as if it didn't include a copy of\r\nlibcygwin.a linked into it.  Note\
    \ that this does not apply to the cygwin\r\nDLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified)\
    \ version of the DLL\r\nyou must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e. you must provide sources\r\
    \nfor the cygwin DLL.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/ for the precise Open\
    \ Source\r\nDefinition referenced above.\r\n\r\nRed Hat sells a special Cygwin License for\
    \ customers who are unable to\r\nprovide their application in open source code form.  For\
