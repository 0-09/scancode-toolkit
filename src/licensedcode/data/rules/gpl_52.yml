    \ \n\nThe original tarball for automake found in this RPM contains a GPL 2.0 text\nat the\
    \ top-level and a GPL 3.0 text at the same level as ansiknr.c. Since\nansiknr.c copyright\
    \ pre-dates the GPL 3.0 and the notice has no version\nstated, this rule is defined to match\
    \ a bare GPL rather than a GPL 3.0. GPL\n3.0 is the license for automake proper and unlikely\
    \ the license for\nansiknr.c."
